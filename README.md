## Subtotal Calculator

Technologies Used: Java. Maven, JavaMail API

This subtotal calculator is made for anyone (ideally small business owners) who want to keep track of their expenses. This calculator reads in a CSV file containing transactions from throughout a time period, modifies this data so that it groups and adds all similar transaction amounts and then automatically sends this updataed data in an new attached CSV file via email. This makes it easier for the user to understand which categories of their expenses can be cut down and can help them get a better understanding of how to appropriately budget their money.
